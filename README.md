# wmts-php-core

**A minimal, framework-agnostic PHP library for building WMTS (Web Map Tile Service) servers.**  
This core package provides WMTS logic and data structures entirely in memory, without any external dependencies or database.

## Features

- WMTS 1.0.0-compliant GetCapabilities, GetTile, and GetFeatureInfo endpoints
- Pure PHP, no framework required
- Simple classes: Project, Layer, Feature, etc.
- Easy to extend or integrate into other PHP applications

## Getting Started

```bash
composer require wmts-php/core

You can instantiate your own Project, Layer, and Feature objects in your script and start serving tiles via PHP.


## Example
